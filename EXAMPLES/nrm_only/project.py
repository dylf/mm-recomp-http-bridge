# ============== Job Variables ==============

# This template is based around the concept of declaring inter-dependent jobs that run based on task the user invokes.

# If you declare a job, add it to one of these dicts to make it directly invokable from the command line.
# Jobs are considered 'resolved' if the job is run, or if it's determined the job doesn't need to run.
# For example, a download is 'resolved' if the download is run, or if the downloaded file is already present.
# When a job is run, it will automatically resolve any other jobs it depends on. However, the root job must still be invoked 
# (meaning you need to add it to one of these dicts, and run ./modbuild.py with the appropriate subcommand). If a job is 
# resolved by determining it doesn't need to run, the dependency jobs will also not be resolved, as it is assumed those jobs
# do not need to run either.

# In this file, you will only need to create the job instances. Actually resolving jobs is handled in tasks.py
# We don't need to declare the jobs here. We'll just create the dicts and populate them as we go.

build_outputs: dict[str, BuildOutputJob] = {}
thunderstore_packages: dict[str, ThunderstorePackageJob] = {}

# Every job has a dict member called `mod_output_files`, which specifies what files (if any) the job generates that are required for the mod
# to run (such as the .nrm file or an extlib), i.e. files that should go in Zelda64Recompiled's 'mods' folder or a Thunderstore package.
# It is acceptable to add additional mod_output_files to any job, either by accessing 'my_job.mod_output_files' directly, or using 
# the `add_mod_output_files` method that all job types have.

# Each key/value pair in `mod_output_files` represents a file to include, and should follow this pattern:
# * The key will be relative path, indicating the location in a build output folder or thunderstore package.
# * The value is the path to the file in this project, for example, a file built by CMake.

# It is important to understand that the term 'mod_output_file[s]' refers this behavior specifically, and just any file created by a job.
# For instance, DownloadJobs do not assume that you want include the downloaded file as part of the mod, and thus the downloaded file is 
# not part of mod_output_files. If you want to include it, you should add it manually. The same is true of ArchiveExtractJobs.
 
# In this template, only ModTomlJobs will specify a mod_output_file automatically (the resultant .nrm), and only CMakeBuildJobs require
# you to specify mod_output_files when declaring the job. Other jobs are allowed to have mod_output_files, but only if you declare them manually.

# You can also declare additional job types by subclassing `modbuildcore.job_base.JobBase`.

# It also contains builds of the RecompModTool and the other N64Recomp tools.

# The 'zig' download/extraction is the complete binary package for the Zig, since this template offers cross-compilation using Zig's C/C++ compiler/linker. 
# Zig isn't available on every package manager (and is a mercifully small download compared to LLVM), so it's easier to download it here.
# The advantage of declaring these compilers as downloads is that you can be confident that other developers/GitHub Actions will always have the correct/same

# Alternatively, you can just copy the 'assets' folder into ./test_env and run your normal installation of Zelda64Recompiled
